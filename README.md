## Professional Experience  

### **University of Oklahoma**  
**Graduate Research Assistant**  
*February 2024 - Present*  
- Analyzed and transformed complex EEG data using Python and Matlab to create B.I.D.S. compliant structures for research.  
- Researched on identifying different types of Cortical Activity patterns (CAPs) in the brain with the help of various unsupervised machine learning algorithms.  
- Used ANOVA, t-tests, Bonferroni correction, and other statistical methods to identify statistically significant differences between transient CAPs and studied both resting-state and stimulus-driven conditions.  
- Visualized CAP transitions and their metrics using figures like bar plots, heat maps, and 3D cortical activity maps.  

### **Tata Consultancy Services**  
**Software Engineer**  
*February 2021 - July 2023*  
- Designed intelligent RPA solutions using Automation 360, VBA scripts, and SQL queries to automate repetitive tasks across SAP, Winshuttle, and Mainframe systems.
